# Code School of Guam - Frequently Asked Questions

## Getting Started

### Do I need prior coding experience?
No prior coding experience is required. Our program starts from the basics and builds up to advanced concepts. The 5-week pre-work phase is designed to bring complete beginners up to speed with programming fundamentals.

### Do I need to have a Mac to join the program?
While it's not mandatory to have a Mac, we highly recommend it. Using a Mac helps ensure uniformity in the classroom, simplifying setup processes and minimizing technical issues that can arise from different operating systems. This allows you to focus more on learning coding concepts rather than dealing with OS-specific challenges. If you don't have a Mac, you're still welcome to join, but please be aware that some steps and commands may differ slightly.

### What resources do you recommend to get started with coding?
We recommend exploring free coding platforms like freeCodeCamp or Replit to get familiar with coding concepts and practice in-browser before starting pre-work.

## Program Format

### Are the classes held in-person or online?
All our classes are conducted fully remotely via Zoom. This allows you to participate in live, interactive sessions from anywhere with a reliable internet connection. Our online format provides flexibility and convenience while maintaining a high level of engagement and support. Optional in-person sessions may also be available.

### What is the class schedule?
Live classes are Monday through Thursday, 6:00pm - 9:00pm (Guam time), with 3-4 hours of weekend homework. This schedule is designed for working professionals.

### Is the program fully remote?
Yes! All classes are conducted remotely via video conferencing, allowing you to learn from anywhere.

## Curriculum

### Why do you teach Ruby on Rails instead of other programming languages?
We have chosen Ruby on Rails because it's a powerful, beginner-friendly framework that allows for rapid development. It's used by many successful companies like Airbnb, GitHub, and Shopify. Our instructors have professional experience with Rails, ensuring high-quality teaching and real-world insights. Learning Rails provides a strong foundation, making it easier to pick up other languages in the future.

### What will I learn?
You'll learn Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React, Python, and AI Engineering. You'll build real-world projects including full-stack applications and AI-powered chatbots.

## Internship & Career

### How does the internship work?
The internship is completely optional and unpaid — it's designed for graduates who want to build their portfolio with real-world experience before job hunting. You'll work on production applications at Shimizu Technology in 2-week Agile sprints over 10 weeks. Separately, we offer paid opportunities for top performers: Teaching Assistant positions for the next cohort, and Junior Software Engineer contracts with Shimizu Technology.

### Are there opportunities to become a teaching assistant?
Yes! Outstanding graduates may be invited to become paid teaching assistants for future cohorts, providing leadership experience and reinforcing your own learning.

## Access & Support

### How long do I have access to the class recordings?
You will have lifetime access to all class recordings, in-class resources, and learning materials, supporting your continued learning journey indefinitely.

### Can I reach out for support after the program ends?
We are here to support you even after your cohort concludes. Feel free to reach out with questions or for guidance.

## Pricing & Payment

### Why is the tuition set at $7,500?
We strive to provide high-quality education with personalized attention through small class sizes and offer real-world experience via internships. Our tuition reflects the value and unique opportunities we provide, while remaining more affordable than many comparable programs. The tuition was recently reduced from $10,000 to $7,500.

### Do you offer payment plans?
Yes, we offer monthly installment plans during the course duration. We have also partnered with PFC Finance for student loan options.
