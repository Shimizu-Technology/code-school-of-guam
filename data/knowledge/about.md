### Graduate Testimonials

**Noah Peredo** - Graduate
> "Clear mind and trust the process. CSG will match the effort that you give it, so at the end of the day, how bad do you want it?"

**Jessica Fernandez** - Graduate
> "I am very very VERY glad I enrolled and finished it! Now, I constantly think about ways I could 'hack' my daily life by creating apps. Leon was extremely helpful in answering all my questions and providing valuable guidance."

**Alanna Cruz** - Software Engineer
> "The Code School of Guam provided me with a comprehensive curriculum covering Ruby, Rails, React, and now Python & AI Engineering. The expert guidance and hands-on projects prepared me perfectly for my software engineering career!"

### Graduate Spotlights

**Alanna Cruz** - TA & Junior Software Engineer
Alanna always felt like the "least tech-savvy" person in her family. She signed up the day before class started, not knowing if she could do it. Today she's a Teaching Assistant for the current cohort AND a Junior Software Engineer at Shimizu Technology. If she can do it, anyone can.

**Audreana Lett** - Coding Instructor at Father Duenas Memorial School
While taking our program, Audreana was already teaching at Father Duenas Memorial School. She was passionate about bringing coding to high schoolers — so we made it happen. She now teaches 15 students across two courses (Intro to Scripting with Ruby and Intro to HTML/CSS/JavaScript), showing the next generation that coding is a real career path.

## Father Duenas Memorial School Partnership

Our first high school partnership! Audreana Lett, a graduate from our very first cohort, is now teaching coding electives at Father Duenas Memorial School — Leon's own high school alma mater. She's bringing a simplified version of our curriculum to high schoolers, proving that coding is a real career path they can start exploring now.

- **15 Students** enrolled across two elective courses
- **Courses Offered**: Intro to Scripting with Ruby, Intro to HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **Capstone projects completed** by students
