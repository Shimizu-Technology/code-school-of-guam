      <h3>Why Code School of Guam?</h3>
      <p>
        At Code School of Guam, we prioritize hands-on learning and mentorship.
        Our classes are intentionally kept small (max 10 students per class)
        to ensure personalized attention and support for every student. This
        allows students to build strong relationships with their instructors
        and peers, fostering a collaborative learning environment where
        everyone is set up for success.
      </p>

      <h3>Class Schedule</h3>
      <p>
        Our current classes are held Monday through Thursday from 6:00 PM to
        9:00 PM and Saturdays from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM. This schedule allows
        flexibility for those who are working or have other commitments during
        the day.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are planning to add daytime classes in the future as demand grows.
        Stay tuned for updates!
      </p>
