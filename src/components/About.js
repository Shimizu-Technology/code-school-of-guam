      <h3>Why Code School of Guam?</h3>
      <p>
        At Code School of Guam, we prioritize hands-on learning and mentorship. Our classes are intentionally kept small (max 10 students per class)
        to ensure personalized attention and support for every student. This allows students to build strong relationships with their instructors and peers,
        fostering a collaborative learning environment where everyone is set up for success.
      </p>

      <h3>Meet Our Founder</h3>
      <p>
        The founder of Code School of Guam is a college dropout who found direction after enrolling in a coding bootcamp. With over three years of experience as a full-time software engineer, they’ve worked for various companies, gaining insight into different work environments and styles. 
        After completing the same bootcamp multiple times as a teacher’s assistant, they went on to become an instructor at that school before founding Code School of Guam.
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea of starting a coding school had been in the works for a long time, but it was important to wait until the right time to ensure students had the best opportunity for success. 
        After starting a software firm, the opportunity arose to offer real-world internships to students, which bridges the gap between education and employment.
        Now, Code School of Guam gives students hands-on experience and the best chance to succeed in their careers.
