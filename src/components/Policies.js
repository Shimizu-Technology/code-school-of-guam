      <h3>Attendance Policy</h3>
      <p>
        Attendance is crucial for your success. Students are expected to attend all scheduled classes punctually. Missing more than three unexcused classes may result in dismissal from the program without a refund. Excused absences are allowed for situations beyond your control (e.g., medical emergencies). Documentation may be required after three excused absences.
      </p>

      <h3>Admissions Communication</h3>
      <p>
        After submitting your application, you will receive a series of emails detailing next steps. This includes scheduling an interview, payment instructions for the deposit, and onboarding information.
      </p>

      <h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
      <p>
        We are committed to providing a respectful and inclusive learning environment. Students are expected to treat all individuals with respect and courtesy. Discrimination, harassment, or inappropriate behavior will not be tolerated. Violations may result in disciplinary action, up to dismissal without a refund.
      </p>

      <h3>Refund Policy</h3>
      <p>
        The non-refundable deposit is required to secure your enrollment. Full tuition (minus the deposit) is refundable if you withdraw before the start of the second week of classes. No refunds will be issued from the second week onward. Students dismissed due to violations of the Code of Conduct or failure to meet program requirements are not eligible for a refund.
      </p>

      <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
      <p>
        Students must submit original work unless collaboration is explicitly permitted. Cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance are prohibited and may result in disciplinary action, including dismissal without a refund.
      </p>

      <h3>Privacy and Data Protection</h3>
      <p>
        We collect personal information during enrollment and coursework to enhance your learning experience. This information is used solely for educational and administrative purposes. By enrolling, you consent to the collection and use of your data as described.
