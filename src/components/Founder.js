      <h2>About the Founder</h2>
      <p>
        Hafa Adai! I'm Leon Shimizu, born and raised in Guam. After graduating
        from Father Duenas Memorial School in 2017, I pursued mechanical
        engineering and played football at Allegheny College in Pennsylvania.
        While I wasn't entirely certain of my career path, my passion for math
        and encouragement from family and friends led me toward engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        After my first year of college, upon learning that I was expecting my first child,
        I returned to Guam to be with my family and then in 2019, I moved to Las Vegas to pursue
        new opportunities while still being with family. As the pandemic began, I decided to
        leave college and enter the workforce full-time. I started as a produce clerk at
        Vons and later joined an Amazon Fulfillment Center, where I quickly advanced to
        Process Assistant at the Dock. Although I gained valuable experience in these
        roles, I realized that I wanted to pursue a more fulfilling, long-term career path.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the summer of 2021, inspired by family members who transitioned into software
        engineering through coding bootcamps, I decided to explore a career in coding.
        After extensive research on the best path forward, I enrolled in Actualize
        Coding Bootcamp, left my job at Amazon, and fully committed to learning software development.
        While it was challenging, I was determined to succeed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before the bootcamp concluded, I was fortunate to secure a position with Spectrio LLC,
        where I currently work and over the past few years, I’ve also had the privilege of giving
        back to the coding community by working as an instructor and Teaching Assistant at
        Actualize, and contributing to another company called SkillsEngine. These experiences
        deepened my passion and knowledge for coding and education in general.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a couple of years now, my mom encouraged me to start a code school in Guam. I hesitated
        at first, feeling unsure about my readiness and the challenge of helping others succeed
        in a competitive industry. However, I realized there is no better time than now to give
        back to the island that shaped who I am today.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's why I started the Code School of Guam. My goal is to provide the same opportunities
        I was fortunate to receive in the states, right here at home. Also, to further support our students, I founded
        a software firm where they can intern, work on real projects, and gain practical experience—an
        essential factor that employers are actively seeking.
      </p>
      <p>
        My mission is to help others realize that a career in software engineering is attainable,
        and I'm here to support them every step of the way. If I can do it, so can you.
